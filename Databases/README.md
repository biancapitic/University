# Mountain Trails from Romania
I created a database for mountain trails from Romania. It contains informations about Trails, Cottages, Mountain Refugees, Touristic Objectives, etc.
The project is done in **SQL Server** and uses **T-SQL**. 
Assignments:
1. Create the database and its tables.
2. Add data to tables and have several queries with the data from the tables.
3. Create a versioning mechanism that allows you to easily switch between database versions using stored procedures.
4. Test the database:
   - ScriptLab4 creates 8 tables in which we insert data from different test that are done on the database;
   - Each test uses certain tables and views. From each table all the data is deleted and a certain number of rows containing random data is inserted. The views of that test are        excuted.
   - All of the testing operations are done using **generic procedures**.
5. Use **indexes** (clustered and nonclustered) to see how they can imporve database queries.
