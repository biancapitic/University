# Toy Language Interpreter

This project is done in **Java** and it implements an interpretor for a toy language. 
It is an ongoing project implemented using **Model-View-Controller design pattern and layered architecture pattern**. 

I implemented:
- ADTs for the toy language: Dictionary, Heap, List and Stack;
- Expressions for the toy language: Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Value, Variable and HeapReading;
- Statements for the toy language: **If** statement, **While** statement, **Fork** statement, **Open/Close/Read file** statements, **Memory handling** statements, **Variable declaration**;
- Types and values for the toy language: Boolean, Integer, Reference, String;

I also used concurrency in my implementation.
