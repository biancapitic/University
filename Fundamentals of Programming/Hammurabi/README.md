# Hammurabi

The application is an implementation of the well known Hammurabi game. The game consists of 5 rounds where the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their city land to buy or sell, how many units of grain he will use to feed the population and how many acres of land are planted with the grain. Each person needs 20 units of grain to survive. Each round represents a year. If more than half of the population dies in a year the game is over. After 5 years, if the population is greater than 100 and the city owns over 1000 acres of land, the player wins, otherwise he looses.

The application has a layered architecture.
