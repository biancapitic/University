# Requirement

Write a program that, given a graph with costs, does the following:
- verify if the corresponding graph is a DAG and performs a topological sorting of the activities using the algorithm based on depth-first traversal (Tarjan's algorithm);
- if it is a DAG, finds a highest cost path between two given vertices, in O(m+n).

The requirement is solved on my implementation of a directed graph. The application implements also other operations besides the required ones.
